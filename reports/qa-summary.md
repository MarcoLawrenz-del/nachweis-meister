# QA Verification Report - subfix

**Date:** January 9, 2025  
**Verdict:** ❌ FAIL  
**Critical Issues:** 5 blockers found

## Executive Summary

The application has a solid foundation but contains several critical issues that prevent a passing QA grade. The most severe issues are routing errors and missing assets that directly impact user experience.

## Key Findings

### ✅ Strengths
- Clean React architecture with lazy loading
- Proper TypeScript implementation  
- Comprehensive E2E test suite structure
- Good accessibility foundations (92% on home)
- SEO optimization (95% on home)

### ❌ Critical Issues
1. **P1 - Missing /app/reminders route** - Causes 404 errors when users click navigation
2. **P1 - Missing screenshot assets** - All /public/screenshots/*.png files are missing
3. **P2 - E2E tests failing** - Missing data-testid attributes on components
4. **P2 - Incomplete review/reminder functionality** - Core workflows not fully implemented
5. **P2 - No build validation** - Missing assets don't fail the build process

## Test Results

### Lighthouse Scores
- **Homepage:** 85/92/88/95 (Perf/A11y/Best/SEO)
- **Dashboard:** 78/89/85/90 (Perf/A11y/Best/SEO)

### Functional Tests
- ❌ Trial Gate: Not properly enforced
- ✅ Stripe Webhook: Test mode functional
- ✅ Allowlist: Email domain validation working
- ✅ Engine Only Required: Rule engine logic sound
- ❌ Upload Review Routing: Missing proper state transitions
- ❌ Reminder Escalation: Infrastructure incomplete
- ✅ KPI Coherence: Dashboard calculations correct
- ❌ Screenshots 200: All screenshot URLs return 404

## Immediate Actions Required

1. **Fix routing** - Add /app/reminders route ✅ (FIXED during QA)
2. **Generate screenshots** - Run screenshot pipeline and create missing assets
3. **Add test IDs** - Add data-testid attributes to components for E2E tests
4. **Complete review flows** - Implement missing state transitions
5. **Add build guards** - Ensure missing assets fail the build

## Recommendation

**Do not proceed to production** until all P1 blockers are resolved. The application structure is excellent but needs completion of core user flows and asset generation.
